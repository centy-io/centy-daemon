# .worktree.toml — per-repo worktree configuration
# Commit this file to version-control to share settings with your team.

[hooks]
# Configure lifecycle hooks that run when a worktree for this repo is opened.
# Each hook is a shell command (string) executed in the worktree directory.
# Mustache templating is supported (same variables as global hooks).
#
# Hook ordering controls how a per-repo hook interacts with the global hook
# configured in the runner's main config. Allowed values:
#   "before"  — run the per-repo hook first, then the global hook
#   "after"   — run the global hook first, then the per-repo hook
#   "replace" — skip the global hook entirely, run only the per-repo hook
#
# "pre:open" = "cargo build"
# "pre:open:order" = "before"   # default: "before"
#
"post:open" = "cargo build"
"post:open:order" = "before" # default: "before"
