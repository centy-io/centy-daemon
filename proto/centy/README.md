# Centy Proto Versions

## v1 (Locked)

Stable API version. No breaking changes allowed — only additive, backwards-compatible modifications (new fields, new RPCs).

## v2 (Under Construction)

Next API version, actively being developed. Breaking changes are permitted until the version is finalized and locked.
