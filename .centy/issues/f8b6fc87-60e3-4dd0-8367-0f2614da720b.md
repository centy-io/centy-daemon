# Add cascade flag to DeleteOrganization RPC

## Summary

Add a `cascade: bool` flag to `DeleteOrganizationRequest` that, when set, automatically untracks all projects belonging to the org before deleting it.

## Current Behavior

`DeleteOrganization` fails with `HasProjects` error if the org has any assigned projects, requiring the caller to manually untrack each project first.

## Desired Behavior

When `cascade = true`:
1. Untrack all projects currently assigned to the org
2. Delete the org

When `cascade = false` (default): keep existing behavior (fail if projects exist).

## Changes Required

- **Proto**: Add `bool cascade = 2` to `DeleteOrganizationRequest` in `proto/centy/v1/centy.proto`
- **Registry**: Update `delete_organization` in `src/registry/organizations/delete.rs` to accept a cascade param, iterating over org projects and calling `untrack_project` for each before removing the org
- **Handler**: Pass the flag through in `src/server/handlers/organization_write.rs`
