# Open in temp vscode

We want to provide an endpoint that, when called, clones the project to a temp folder and opens it in VS Code. In this, VS Code will open a terminal with the user’s favorite code agent after running the command `centy issue <id>` In a plan mode, if supported

As part of this, we want to create an issue for the app, CLI, and tui to implement it.

As the first implementation, we will implement the app first
