# Detect and warn about duplicate project slugs within same organization

## Problem

When two different projects are registered under the same organization with the same slug (derived from folder name), the web UI returns a 404 for the project issues page without any indication of what’s wrong.

### Reproduction

1. Initialize a project at `/path/a/publisher` with organization `myorg`
1. Have another project at `/path/b/publisher` also registered under `myorg` (e.g., from a previous init that no longer has a `.centy` folder)
1. Try to access the project issues page
1. Get a 404 with no explanation

### Example

* `/Users/user/repo-a/publisher` (active, has `.centy` folder)
* `/Users/user/repo-b/apps/publisher` (stale, no `.centy` folder)

Both registered under the same organization, causing a conflict.

## Suggested Solutions

1. **Detection**: When registering a project, check if another project with the same slug already exists under the same organization and warn the user
1. **Cleanup**: Provide a command or automatic detection for stale projects (registered but missing `.centy` folder)
1. **Better error**: Instead of a 404, show a meaningful error in the UI when there’s a slug conflict
1. **List conflicts**: Add a CLI command like `centy diagnose` to detect and report issues like this

## Workaround

Manually untrack the stale project:

````bash
centy untrack project /path/to/stale/project
````
