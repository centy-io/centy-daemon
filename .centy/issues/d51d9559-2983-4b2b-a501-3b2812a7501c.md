# Issues table: center layout and show all columns

\## Problem

The issues table at \`/\[org\]/\[project\]/issues\` has two layout issues:

1\. \*\*Not centered\*\*: The table is left-aligned on the page instead of being horizontally centered like other page content.

2\. \*\*Missing columns\*\*: Only \`#\`, \`Title\`, and \`Status\` columns are visible. Other relevant columns (e.g. Priority, Assignee, Labels, etc.) are not shown.

\## Expected Behavior

\- The issues table container should be centered on the page, consistent with the rest of the app layout.

\- All available columns should be displayed in the table so users can see full issue metadata at a glance.
