# Merge OpenInTempVscode and OpenInTempTerminal into unified OpenTempWorkspace RPC

Currently there are two separate RPC endpoints:

* OpenInTempVscode - opens workspace in VS Code
* OpenInTempTerminal - opens workspace in Terminal

These should be merged into a single OpenTempWorkspace RPC that accepts an editor_type parameter (EditorType enum: VSCODE, TERMINAL).

Changes needed:

1. Add new proto message OpenTempWorkspaceWithEditorRequest with editor_type field
1. Add new RPC OpenTempWorkspace(OpenTempWorkspaceWithEditorRequest) returns (OpenInTempWorkspaceResponse)
1. Implement unified handler in server/mod.rs
1. Deprecate old OpenInTempVscode and OpenInTempTerminal RPCs
