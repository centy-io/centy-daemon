# Projects organization

## Organization Feature Implementation

This issue tracked the planning and implementation of the Projects Organization feature.

### What was implemented

**Core Organization CRUD**
- CreateOrganization, ListOrganizations, GetOrganization, UpdateOrganization, DeleteOrganization RPCs
- Kebab-case slug identifiers with validation
- Portable .centy/organization.json metadata files per project

**Project Grouping**
- SetProjectOrganization RPC to assign/unassign projects to orgs
- Unique project name validation within org scope
- Organization sync from cloned projects

**Auto-Inference**
- Parse git remote URLs (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to detect org
- Background auto-assignment for ungrouped projects at startup
- Mismatch detection between git remote and assigned org

**Organization-Level Issues** (implemented in this PR)
- New RPCs: CreateOrgIssue, GetOrgIssue, GetOrgIssueByDisplayNumber, ListOrgIssues, UpdateOrgIssue, DeleteOrgIssue
- New RPCs: GetOrgConfig, UpdateOrgConfig
- Storage at ~/.centy/orgs/{slug}/issues/{uuid}.md
- Org-scoped display numbers (sequential across all projects in org)
- Issue filtering by status, priority, referenced project
- Referenced projects support for cross-project tracking
