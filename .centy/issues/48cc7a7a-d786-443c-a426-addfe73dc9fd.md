# Automatically add hooks section to config.json for existing projects

When a project’s config.json was created before the hooks system was introduced, it won’t have a hooks section. The daemon should automatically add an empty hooks section to config.json when it detects it’s missing. This ensures all projects have the hooks configuration available without requiring a manual migration or edit. This could be handled during project load or as part of the config normalization step.
