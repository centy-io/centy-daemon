# New state

We want to have a new state in the built in states of the system, the in planing state, when a user set this state we want to have a note in the [](http://issue.md)[issue.md](http://issue.md) file that says to the llm to make sure to not change the code and this is planning only issue, when the planing is finished we want the agent to switch to in progress state and to start implementing the issue, in the planing mode we want the agent to brain storm with the user and after finishing the planning with the user to update the issue with the action plan
