# Consolidate deleted_at into CommonMetadata

Parent: #105

Currently deleted_at is duplicated across Issue, PR, and Doc as a direct field instead of being part of CommonMetadata.

## Scope

* Move deleted_at into CommonMetadata struct
* Update Issue, PR, and Doc to use CommonMetadata.deleted_at
* Update all serialization/deserialization code
* Update SoftDeletable trait implementations to delegate to CommonMetadata
* Ensure backward compatibility with existing .centy files on disk
