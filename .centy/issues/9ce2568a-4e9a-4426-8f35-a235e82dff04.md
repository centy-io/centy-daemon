# Unified Read gRPC RPC

Add a unified Read RPC that replaces the individual Get\* RPCs for issue, doc, and PR entities. Reuses existing EntityType enum. Empty project_path triggers cross-project search. Response uses oneof for polymorphic entity data. Old RPCs stay but are marked deprecated. Network-layer only initially — handler dispatches to existing internal functions.
