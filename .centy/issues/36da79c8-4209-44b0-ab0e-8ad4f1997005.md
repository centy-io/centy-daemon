# Auto repository management

We want to brainstorm about an idea that focus about product manages and there way to work with this project, we don't want the product managers to be responsible about the working of the `.centy` folder git wise, i.e. clone, commit, push, fetch, pull etc… so we want to let them just clone a repo in a simple way and just work with the `centy` system without any knowledge of git
