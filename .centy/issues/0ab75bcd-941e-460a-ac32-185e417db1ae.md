# Generic storage layer for config-driven item types

Parent: #130

Implement a generic storage layer that reads/writes items under .centy/<type>/ based on the config.yaml feature flags.

## Scope

* Generic file read/write for any item type folder
* Path resolution: .centy/<plural>/<slug>.md
* Respect config.yaml features when creating items (e.g., add displayNumber to frontmatter only if feature enabled)
* Generic list operation scanning .centy/<type>/\*.md
* Generic delete (soft delete if feature enabled, hard delete otherwise)
* Unit tests with temp directories
