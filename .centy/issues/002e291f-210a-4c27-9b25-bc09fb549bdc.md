# Show log file location when daemon fails to start

When the daemon fails to start (e.g., address already in use, port binding failure, or any other startup error), the error messages should include the path to the log file so the user knows where to look for more details.

## Current behavior

The “address in use” error in `src/main.rs:184-200` provides helpful options but does not mention the log file. Other startup failures simply propagate the error via `color_eyre` with no hint about logs.

## Expected behavior

All startup failure paths should include a line like:

````
Logs: ~/.centy/logs/centy-daemon.log
````

This applies to:

1. The existing `AddrInUse` error handler (add log path to the options list)
1. The generic `Err(e.into())` fallback at line 199 (add an eprintln before returning)
1. Any future startup errors

## Implementation notes

* The log directory is computed at `src/main.rs:101-106` — store it in a variable accessible at the error handling site
* The log filename is `centy-daemon.log` (hardcoded in `src/logging.rs`)
* If logging itself failed to initialize, mention that logging could not be set up
