# gRPC subscriptions for lifecycle hook events

Add gRPC server-streaming RPCs that allow clients to subscribe to real-time hook events. Implement SubscribeHookEvents that streams hook execution events (started, completed, failed, blocked) as they happen. This enables the TUI to show live hook activity and allows external tools to react to hook events in real-time without polling. Consider supporting filtered subscriptions by item type, operation, or phase.
