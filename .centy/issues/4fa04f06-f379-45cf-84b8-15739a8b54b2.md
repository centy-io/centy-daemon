# Hook execution history and logging

Add persistent hook execution history that tracks every hook invocation with its result. Store execution logs including timestamp, hook pattern, command, exit code, stdout/stderr output, duration, and whether it blocked an operation. Expose this via a gRPC API (ListHookExecutions, GetHookExecution) so the TUI and CLI can display hook activity. This enables debugging failed hooks and auditing hook behavior over time.
