# Custom lifecycle hooks

Centy manages the full lifecycle of project items — creating, updating, listing, deleting, moving, and more. But every team has unique processes that surround these operations. One team might want to send a Slack notification whenever an issue is created. Another might want to run a validation script before an issue can be closed. A third might want to automatically update a changelog after a PR is merged.

Right now, there is no way to plug into these lifecycle events. Users either build external automation that polls for changes or accept that certain workflows cannot be automated through Centy.

We want to introduce a hooks system that lets users configure custom actions that run before and after any operation. These hooks should support both synchronous execution (where the hook must complete before the operation proceeds, allowing it to block or modify the operation) and asynchronous execution (where the hook runs in the background without delaying the main operation).

This turns Centy from a standalone tool into an integration point — a place where project management connects to the rest of the development ecosystem.

Key aspects to consider:

* Hooks should be configurable per operation (create, update, delete, move, duplicate, etc.) and per item type
* Support both pre-hooks (before the operation) and post-hooks (after the operation)
* Pre-hooks running synchronously should be able to block an operation (e.g., validation that prevents closing an issue without a linked PR)
* Post-hooks should support both sync and async execution modes
* Hooks should receive context about the operation: what item, what changed, who triggered it
* Failed async hooks should not break the main operation — they should log errors gracefully
* Users should be able to configure hooks through the project configuration, not code
* Common hook patterns should be easy to set up (shell commands, HTTP webhooks, script files)
