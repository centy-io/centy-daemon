# Init should include hooks property in config.json

When a project is initialized with `centy init`, the generated config.json does not include the `hooks` property. It only gets added lazily when `read_config()` is triggered by another operation (e.g. `centy config`). The init process should generate config.json with `hooks: []` from the start so it’s immediately visible and discoverable for new projects.
