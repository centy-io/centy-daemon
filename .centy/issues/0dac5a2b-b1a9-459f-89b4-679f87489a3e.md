# Configurable editor support

Centy currently has built-in support for two editors: VS Code and the system terminal. These are hardcoded as the only options for opening workspaces, launching agents, and editing items. But developers use a wide variety of editors and IDEs — Neovim, JetBrains products, Zed, Sublime Text, Emacs, and many more. Limiting Centy to just two editors excludes a significant portion of potential users and forces workarounds for teams that do not use VS Code.

We want to replace the hardcoded editor support with a configurable system where users can define their own editors. Each editor definition would specify how to open a project directory, how to open a specific file, and any other commands needed for workspace integration.

This should be flexible enough to support any editor that can be launched from the command line, which covers virtually all modern editors and IDEs. The built-in VS Code and terminal support should be migrated to use this same configuration system, serving as both defaults and examples for users who want to add their own editors.

Key aspects to consider:

* Users should be able to define editors through configuration with a name, open command, and any required arguments
* The built-in VS Code and terminal support should be expressed through this same system as defaults
* Editor definitions should support opening a project directory, opening a specific file at a line number, and any editor-specific setup
* Users should be able to set a default editor globally and override it per-project
* The workspace system (temp workspaces, standalone workspaces) should work with any configured editor
* Editor availability detection should be configurable (e.g., check if a binary exists in PATH)
* The GetSupportedEditors RPC should dynamically reflect the configured editors
