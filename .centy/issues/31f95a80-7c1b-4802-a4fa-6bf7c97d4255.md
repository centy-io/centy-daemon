# Add default “archived” item folder

When a project is initialized with `centy init`, we currently create `issues/` and `docs/` as default item folders. We want to also create an `archived/` folder as another default item folder that serves as the destination for all archived items.

## Motivation

Today, when items are soft-deleted they get a `deleted_at` timestamp but remain in their original folder. There is no concept of archiving as distinct from deletion. Users need a way to move items out of active view without permanently deleting them – a standard "archive" workflow.

The `archived/` folder would act as a catch-all destination for items that are no longer active but should be preserved. This is analogous to how email clients have an "Archive" folder separate from "Trash".

## Design

- On `centy init`, create `.centy/archived/` alongside `.centy/issues/` and `.centy/docs/`
- The `archived/` folder is a default item type defined via the same `config.yaml` system described in #135
- Items from any type (issues, docs, custom types) can be moved into the archived folder
- Archived items retain their original metadata and content
- The archived folder should be filterable/searchable like any other item folder
- Archived items should remember which folder/type they came from before archiving via a custom field

### Folder structure after init

```
.centy/
  issues/
    config.yaml
  docs/
    config.yaml
  archived/
    config.yaml
```

### config.yaml for archived type

```yaml
name: Archived
icon: 📦
features:
  displayNumber: false
  status: false
  priority: false
  softDelete: true
  assets: true
  orgSync: true
  move: true
  duplicate: false
fields:
  - name: original_item_type
    type: string
    description: The item type (folder name) the item was in before being archived
    example: "issues"
```

### Example archived item frontmatter

```yaml
---
original_item_type: issues
---
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `archived/` folder creation to `centy init` alongside `issues/` and `docs/`
1. Create the default `config.yaml` for the archived item type (with `original_item_type` field)
1. Add an "archive" action/command that moves an item from its current folder into `archived/`, setting `original_item_type` to the source folder name
1. Ensure `centy update` migration adds the `archived/` folder to existing projects
1. Update list/search commands to exclude archived items by default (with `--include-archived` flag)
1. Support "unarchive" action that reads `original_item_type` and restores the item to that folder
