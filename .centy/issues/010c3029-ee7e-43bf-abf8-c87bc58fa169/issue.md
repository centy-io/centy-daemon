# Issue linking

We want to have the option to link issues/docs or any uuid item, so for example if we have one issue that is dependent on another issue we can set this relationship, as well as if we have one issue that contains several issues inside of it so we will have parents/sons and pre/post, we want to brainstorm how to do it customizable so the user can define its own types of relationships.
