# Custom templates per item type

Templates define the starting point for every new item in Centy. When a user creates an issue or a doc, the template determines what the initial content looks like — the sections, the prompts, the structure. But right now, templates are generic. There is no way to have different templates for different kinds of work within the same item type, and there is no way to tailor templates to the specific needs of a custom item type.

Consider a team that uses issues for both bug reports and feature requests. A bug report template should prompt for steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior. A feature request template should prompt for the problem statement, proposed solution, and success criteria. These are fundamentally different documents, but today they share the same template.

We want to let users define multiple templates for each item type, and let them choose which template to use when creating a new item. This becomes even more valuable in combination with custom item types — a “feature” type could have its own set of templates that are completely different from an “issue” type.

Templates should be stored as simple files within the project configuration, making them easy to create, share, and version control alongside the rest of the project.

Key aspects to consider:

* Each item type (built-in and custom) should support multiple named templates
* Users should be able to select a template when creating a new item, with a sensible default
* Templates should be stored as files in the project configuration directory for easy editing and version control
* Template files should support variables and placeholders that get filled in at creation time (e.g., date, author, item number)
* It should be possible to set a default template per item type
* Teams should be able to share templates across projects through organization-level configuration
* The template system should be simple enough that creating a new template is just creating a new file with the right structure
