# Custom item types

Today, Centy ships with a fixed set of item types: issues, docs, and pull requests. These cover the most common use cases, but every team works differently. Some teams think in terms of features, bugs, and tasks. Others organize around epics, stories, and spikes. Right now, there is no way to express these concepts natively — users are forced to shoehorn their workflow into the built-in types or rely on naming conventions and tags as workarounds.

We want to let users define their own item types that feel just as natural as the built-in ones. A user should be able to say “I want a feature type” and have it behave like a first-class citizen in Centy — with its own folder structure, its own templates, its own metadata schema, and its own set of allowed statuses and transitions.

This is the foundational change that unlocks much of the rest of the roadmap. Custom templates, custom commands, and custom hooks all become more powerful when they can be scoped to user-defined item types rather than just the hardcoded ones.

Key aspects to consider:

* Users should be able to define new item types through configuration, not code
* Each custom item type should support its own metadata fields, statuses, and priority levels
* Built-in types (issue, doc, PR) should themselves be expressible through this same system for consistency
* Cross-project operations (move, duplicate, search) should work seamlessly with custom types
* The link system should support relationships between any combination of built-in and custom types
* Migration path for existing projects that already have issues and docs
