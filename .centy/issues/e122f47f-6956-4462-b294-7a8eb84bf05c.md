# Custom item types

Today, Centy ships with a fixed set of item types: issues, docs, and pull requests. These cover the most common use cases, but every team works differently. Some teams think in terms of features, bugs, and tasks. Others organize around epics, stories, and spikes. Right now, there is no way to express these concepts natively — users are forced to shoehorn their workflow into the built-in types or rely on naming conventions and tags as workarounds.

We want to let users define their own item types that feel just as natural as the built-in ones. A user should be able to say "I want a feature type" and have it behave like a first-class citizen in Centy — with its own folder structure, its own templates, its own metadata schema, and its own set of allowed statuses and transitions.

## Design Decision: Per-item config.yaml

Each item type is defined by a `config.yaml` file inside its own folder under `.centy/`:

```
.centy/
  issues/
    config.yaml      # schema + config for the "issue" item type
    0001.md
    0002.md
  docs/
    config.yaml      # schema + config for the "doc" item type
    my-doc.md
  features/
    config.yaml      # schema + config for a custom "feature" item type
    feat-login.md
  bugs/
    config.yaml      # schema + config for a custom "bug" item type
```

The `config.yaml` file defines everything about the item type: allowed statuses, priority levels, metadata fields, default template, display name, and feature flags (e.g., whether the type supports display numbers, soft delete, assets, org sync, etc.).

### Built-in types created on init

When the user runs `centy init`, the daemon creates the `issues/` and `docs/` folders with their respective `config.yaml` files pre-populated with sensible defaults. These built-in types use the exact same config.yaml system as custom types — there is no special-cased code path for built-in vs custom.

### Creating a custom item type

To add a custom item type, the user creates a new folder under `.centy/` (e.g., `.centy/features/`) and adds a `config.yaml` inside it. The daemon discovers item types by scanning for `config.yaml` files in direct subdirectories of `.centy/`.

### Key principles

- Item types are defined by the presence of a `config.yaml` file in a `.centy/<type>/` directory
- Built-in types (issue, doc) are just pre-created instances of this same system
- The daemon discovers types at startup by scanning `.centy/*/config.yaml`
- No central registry file — the folder structure IS the registry
- Each type is self-contained: its config, templates, and items all live in its own folder
- Cross-project operations (move, duplicate, search) work seamlessly with custom types
- The link system supports relationships between any combination of types
- Migration path: existing projects already have `.centy/issues/` and `.centy/docs/` folders, they just need `config.yaml` files added (migration on `centy update`)

### config.yaml example (issue type)

```yaml
name: Issue
plural: issues
icon: 📋
features:
  displayNumber: true
  status: true
  priority: true
  softDelete: true
  assets: true
  orgSync: true
  move: true
  duplicate: true
statuses:
  - open
  - in-progress
  - closed
  - testing
defaultStatus: open
priorityLevels: 3
customFields: []
template: template.md
```
