# Custom item types

Today, Centy ships with a fixed set of item types: issues, docs, and pull requests. We want to let users define their own item types that feel just as natural as the built-in ones.

## Design Decision: Per-item config.yaml

Each item type is defined by a config.yaml file inside its own folder under .centy/:

```
.centy/
  issues/
    config.yaml
    0001.md
  docs/
    config.yaml
    my-doc.md
  features/
    config.yaml     # custom type
```

Key principles:

- Item types defined by presence of config.yaml in .centy/<type>/
- Built-in types (issue, doc) created by centy init with default config.yaml
- Daemon discovers types at startup by scanning .centy/\*/config.yaml
- No central registry file — folder structure IS the registry
- Each type is self-contained: config, templates, items all in its own folder
- Migration: centy update adds config.yaml to existing issue/doc folders

### config.yaml example

```yaml
name: Issue
features:
  displayNumber: true
  status: true
  priority: true
  softDelete: true
  assets: true
  orgSync: true
statuses:
  - open
  - in-progress
  - closed
defaultStatus: open
priorityLevels: 3
template: template.md
```
