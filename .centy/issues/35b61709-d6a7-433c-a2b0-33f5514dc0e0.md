# Data restoration

We want to have sanity mechanism for the files, for example: an issue metadata.json file should always have the dates, if there are missing and the file is inside a repository let the user know the field is missing and look for the original value via the git history, if found provide the user with the value and ask if they want to restore it, if missing ask him if to leave undefined or put the default value, i.e. for times is now

We need to brainstorm this idea more
