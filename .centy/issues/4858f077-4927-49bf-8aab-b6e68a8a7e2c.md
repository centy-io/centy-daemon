# Issue Conversation Feature

Enable team discussions and decision logging on issues (and other entities).

---

## Design Decisions

|Area|Decision|
|----|--------|
|**Use Cases**|Async team discussions + Decision logging|
|**Storage**|File-based, git-friendly|
|**Threading**|Flat + threaded replies using CRDT|
|**CRDT Library**|Yrs (Yjs Rust port)|
|**File Format**|JSON (human-readable, git-diff friendly)|
|**File Location**|Entity folder (`.centy/{entity-type}/{id}/conversation.json`)|
|**Edit/Delete**|Tombstones only (mark deleted, keep last edit)|
|**API**|Generic `ConversationService` (entity-agnostic)|
|**Scope**|Start with issues, design for all entities|
|**Schema**|Minimal v1, extend later|

## Why CRDT?

CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) solve the git merge conflict problem:

* Multiple contributors can add comments offline
* Git merges become automatic (no conflicts)
* Order is preserved even with concurrent edits
* Deletions/edits represented as operations

---

## Minimal Comment Schema (v1)

````
Comment {
  id: UUID
  author: { name, email }  // from git config
  content: String (Markdown)
  parent_id: Option<UUID>  // for threading (null = top-level)
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Option<Timestamp>
  deleted: bool  // tombstone marker
}
````

## File Structure

````
.centy/issues/{uuid}/
├── issue.md          # Title + Description
├── metadata.json     # Status, priority, timestamps
├── links.json        # Related issues/docs/PRs
├── conversation.json # NEW: CRDT-backed conversation
└── assets/           # Attached files
````

---

## API Design

Generic `ConversationService` that works with any entity type:

* `AddComment(entity_type, entity_id, content, parent_id?)`
* `ListComments(entity_type, entity_id)`
* `UpdateComment(entity_type, entity_id, comment_id, content)`
* `DeleteComment(entity_type, entity_id, comment_id)` (tombstone)

## Open Questions (for future)

1. **Git Merge Strategy**: Does Yrs handle JSON merging automatically? Need custom git merge driver?

1. **CLI Commands**: How should `centy` CLI expose conversations?
   
   * `centy issue comment add <id> "message"`?
   * `centy issue conversation <id>`?
1. **Notifications/Mentions**: Out of scope for v1

1. **Performance**: How does Yrs JSON export scale with large conversations?

1. **Real-time sync**: Future consideration for collaborative editing
