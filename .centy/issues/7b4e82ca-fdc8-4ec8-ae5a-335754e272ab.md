# Add ListItemTypes gRPC endpoint

The daemon has no endpoint to list all item types of a project. Internally, ItemTypeRegistry::build() scans .centy/\*/config.yaml to discover item types, but this is not exposed via the gRPC API. Add a ListItemTypes RPC that returns all registered item types and their configs for a given project.
