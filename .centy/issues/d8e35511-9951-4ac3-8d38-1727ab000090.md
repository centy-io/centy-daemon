# Enforce 100-line file size limit for new files

Add a lint or CI check that enforces a maximum of 100 lines per file for newly created files. Existing files that exceed this limit should be ignored (grandfathered in) - no refactoring required.

## Goal

Ensure that all new source files stay small and focused by enforcing a 100-line limit. This promotes better code organization, single-responsibility modules, and easier code review.

## Requirements

* Only enforce the limit on **new files** - existing files exceeding 100 lines are exempt
* The check should fail if a newly created file has more than 100 lines
* Establish a baseline of current files that exceed the limit so they can be excluded
* Apply to source code files (`.rs`, `.proto`, etc.) - exclude generated files, lock files, and config files

## Implementation Notes

* Consider using a git-based approach: compare against the base branch to detect new files, then check their line count
* Alternatively, maintain an allowlist of existing files that exceed the limit
* This could be implemented as a CI check, pre-commit hook, or clippy/custom lint
