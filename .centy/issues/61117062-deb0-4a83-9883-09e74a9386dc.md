# Wire up check_version_for_operation function

The `check_version_for_operation` function in `src/version/mod.rs:37` is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase.

## Current State

* Function exists and logs warnings when project version > daemon version (degraded mode)
* Returns `VersionComparison` enum (Equal, ProjectBehind, ProjectAhead)
* No operations actually check version compatibility before executing

## Expected Behavior

* Key operations (create issue, update issue, create doc, etc.) should call this function
* When `ProjectBehind`: Log info that update is available
* When `ProjectAhead`: Log warning about degraded mode
* Optionally: Block certain operations in degraded mode or prompt for migration

## Files

* `src/version/mod.rs:37` - check_version_for_operation function
* `src/server/mod.rs` - gRPC handlers that should call this function
