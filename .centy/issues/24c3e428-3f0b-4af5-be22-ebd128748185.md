# Init hooks.yaml if missing from .centy folder

## Summary

On daemon/CLI startup (or project init), check if `.centy/hooks.yaml` exists. If not, create it with an example hook in a comment and a link to the docs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] If `.centy/hooks.yaml` is absent, auto-create it
- [ ] The generated file contains a commented-out example hook so users understand the syntax at a glance
- [ ] A comment at the top links to the hooks documentation
- [ ] Existing `hooks.yaml` files are never overwritten

## Example generated file

```yaml
# Centy Hooks — https://docs.centy.io/hooks
#
# Example hook:
# hooks:
#   - event: issue.created
#     run: echo "Issue created: $CENTY_ITEM_TITLE"
```
