# Native HTTP webhook support for lifecycle hooks

Add a native webhook hook type alongside shell commands. Instead of requiring users to write curl commands in bash hooks, support a dedicated webhook type that accepts a URL, HTTP method, headers, and payload template. This makes it easy to integrate with services like Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, etc. The webhook type should support configurable retry logic and timeout settings.
