# Open in Terminal should launch agent instead of just clearing screen

When clicking “Open in Terminal” from the app’s issue detail page, the terminal opens at the workspace directory but only runs `clear`. It should launch the agent (e.g. `claude`) with the issue context, matching the behavior of `open_terminal_with_agent`.

## Root Cause

In `src/workspace/orchestrator.rs`, `create_temp_workspace` called the generic `open_editor()` for all editor types. For terminal, this delegated to `open_terminal()` which only runs `clear` — it never called `open_terminal_with_agent()` with the issue display number and agent name.

## Fix

Added `open_editor_for_issue()` helper in `orchestrator.rs` that checks if the editor is Terminal and calls `open_terminal_with_agent` (passing display number and agent name) instead of the generic `open_editor`. Both the new-workspace and reuse-workspace code paths were updated.
