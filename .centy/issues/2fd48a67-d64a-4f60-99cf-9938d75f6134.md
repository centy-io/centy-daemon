# Local tokens

We want to let the user define local tokens, those tokens will be saved in a designated file in the place centy saves user scoped configuration, the tokens will be saved per project or for all projects in the user. The tokens will be encrypted by a password the user will provide, once the user tries to do functionality that requires those tokens the user will have to provide the decryption password as well to be able to decrypt the tokens, as part of this issue we also want to make sure the user scoped `.centy` folder has a .gitignore file as well that will make sure this file is never committed for cases that the user commits his `~/` path to a git

We need to brainstorm and think about this task more
