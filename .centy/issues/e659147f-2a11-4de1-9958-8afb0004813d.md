# Promote clippy::too_many_lines from warn to deny

Related: #55, #113

## Current State

`too_many_lines` is set to `"warn"` in `Cargo.toml:125` but CI, pre-commit, and pre-push hooks all pass `-A clippy::too_many_lines` to clippy, effectively suppressing the warning. This means the lint has no real enforcement.

## Proposed Change

1. Change `too_many_lines = "warn"` to `too_many_lines = "deny"` in `Cargo.toml`
1. Remove the `-A clippy::too_many_lines` override from:
   * `.github/workflows/build.yml:52`
   * `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-commit:25`
   * `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-push:18`
1. Remove the grep guards that check for `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` directives (these become unnecessary once the lint is denied globally)

## Prerequisite

Issue #113 (remove all `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` directives) should be completed first, otherwise promoting to deny will cause immediate build failures.
