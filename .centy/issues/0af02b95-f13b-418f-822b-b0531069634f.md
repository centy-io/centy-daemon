# Custom commands per item type

Different item types often need different workflows and operations. An issue might need a “triage” command that sets priority and assigns it to a team. A feature might need a “promote” command that converts it from a draft into an active roadmap item. A bug report might need a “reproduce” command that sets up a test environment. These are all domain-specific operations that do not fit neatly into the generic CRUD model.

Right now, all item types share the same set of operations — create, read, update, delete, move, duplicate. There is no way to define custom operations that are specific to a particular item type or workflow. Users are left to build these as external scripts that call the Centy API, losing the discoverability and integration benefits of having them as first-class commands.

We want to let users define custom commands for each item type. These commands would appear in the UI alongside the built-in actions, be discoverable through the entity actions system, and have access to the full context of the item they are operating on.

Custom commands bridge the gap between Centy as a data store and Centy as a workflow engine. Combined with custom item types and lifecycle hooks, they allow teams to build complete, tailored workflows that feel native to Centy rather than bolted on from the outside.

Key aspects to consider:

* Users should be able to define commands through configuration, scoped to specific item types
* Commands should appear in the entity actions system so UIs can discover and display them
* Each command should have a name, description, and the action to perform (shell command, script, or built-in operation)
* Commands should receive the full item context (metadata, content, project info) as input
* Commands should be able to modify the item (update status, add fields, change content) as part of their execution
* It should be possible to define keyboard shortcuts for frequently used custom commands
* Commands should support confirmation prompts for destructive or significant operations
* Organization-level commands should be shareable across all projects in an organization
