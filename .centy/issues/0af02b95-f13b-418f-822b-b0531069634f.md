# Custom commands per item type

Different item types often need different workflows and operations. An issue might need a "triage" command that sets priority and assigns it to a team. A feature might need a "promote" command that converts it from a draft into an active roadmap item. A bug report might need a "reproduce" command that sets up a test environment.

## Design Decision: Commands defined in config.yaml

With the per-item config.yaml approach (see #135), custom commands are defined inside each item type's config.yaml:

```yaml
# .centy/issues/config.yaml
name: Issue
commands:
  - name: triage
    description: Set priority and assign to team
    action: shell
    command: "./scripts/triage.sh {item_id}"
    confirm: true
  - name: escalate
    description: Escalate to high priority
    action: builtin
    updates:
      priority: 1
      status: in-progress
```

```yaml
# .centy/features/config.yaml
name: Feature
commands:
  - name: promote
    description: Promote from draft to active roadmap
    action: shell
    command: "./scripts/promote-feature.sh {item_id}"
```

## Key aspects

- Commands are defined in the item type's config.yaml, scoped to that type
- Commands appear in the entity actions system so UIs can discover and display them
- Each command has a name, description, and action (shell command, script, or built-in operation)
- Commands receive the full item context (metadata, content, project info) as input
- Commands can modify the item (update status, add fields, change content) as part of execution
- Commands support confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Organization-level commands can be shared across all projects
