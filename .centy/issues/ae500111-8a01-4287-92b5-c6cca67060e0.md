# Remove softDelete from config.yaml - it should always be true

The softDelete feature flag in item type config.yaml files is unnecessary. Soft delete should always be enabled for all item types — there is no use case where we want to permanently delete items without soft delete.

## Goal

Remove the softDelete option from config.yaml files and hardcode it to always be true in the codebase.

## Requirements

* Remove the softDelete field from all existing config.yaml files (e.g., .centy/issues/config.yaml, .centy/docs/config.yaml)
* Remove softDelete from the config schema/type definitions
* Hardcode soft delete behavior to always be enabled in the code that currently reads this config value
* Update any templates that generate config.yaml files to no longer include softDelete
* Ensure init does not write softDelete to new config files
