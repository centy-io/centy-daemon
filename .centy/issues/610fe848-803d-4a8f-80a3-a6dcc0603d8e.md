# Add centy-cli-only header comment to all daemon-managed files

## Goal

Every file the daemon creates or manages (issue markdown files, hooks.yaml, .centy/ config files, etc.) should start with a comment telling users to manage it via the Centy CLI instead of editing it manually.

## Comment format

- YAML / TOML / shell: `# This file is managed by Centy. Use the Centy CLI to modify it.`
- Markdown: `<!-- This file is managed by Centy. Use the Centy CLI to modify it. -->`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Header comment is inserted as the first line of every newly created daemon-managed file
- Existing files missing the comment get it prepended on first write
- Comment syntax matches the file type
- Files not managed by the daemon are not touched
