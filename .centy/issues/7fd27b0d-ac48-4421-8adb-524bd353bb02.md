# Remove defaultState from config.json

The defaultState field in .centy/config.json is now redundant. The per-item-type config.yaml files (e.g., .centy/issues/config.yaml) already have their own defaultStatus field, which is what the generic item creation path uses.

The legacy issue creation code path (src/item/entities/issue/create.rs) still reads default_state from config.json. This should be updated to read from the item-type config instead, after which defaultState can be removed from the root config entirely.

This involves:

* Updating the legacy issue creation path to use defaultStatus from .centy/issues/config.yaml instead of default_state from config.json
* Removing the default_state field from the Config struct in src/config/mod.rs
* Removing the default_state mapping in src/config/item_type_config.rs
* Removing default_state from the gRPC config proto conversion (proto_to_config.rs, config_to_proto.rs)
* Removing the default_state validation in src/server/validate_config.rs
* Removing defaultState from .centy/config.json
* Updating related tests
