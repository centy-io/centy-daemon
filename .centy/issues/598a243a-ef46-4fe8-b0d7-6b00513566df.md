# Configurable project folder name

The .centy folder is the heart of every project managed by Centy. It stores issues, docs, PRs, assets, configuration, and the manifest. But the name “.centy” ties the tool to a specific brand rather than describing what it actually does — it is a local project management folder.

We want to give users the freedom to choose what this folder is called. Some teams might prefer .tasks, .project, .tracker, or something that fits their existing conventions. The name should be a configuration option, not a hardcoded assumption baked into every path and operation.

This matters for adoption. Teams evaluating Centy alongside other tools may hesitate if the folder name feels too opinionated or branded. A generic, configurable name signals that Centy is a flexible framework rather than a rigid product.

At the same time, backward compatibility is essential. Existing projects that already use .centy must continue to work without any manual migration. The system should detect and respect the existing folder name while allowing new projects to choose their own.

Key aspects to consider:

* The default folder name should remain .centy for backward compatibility
* Users should be able to configure the folder name globally (for all new projects) or per-project
* Existing projects with .centy should be auto-detected and continue working without changes
* All internal references, paths, and operations must use the configured name dynamically
* The daemon, CLI, and any integrations should all respect the configured folder name
* Documentation and error messages should reference the configured name, not hardcoded .centy
