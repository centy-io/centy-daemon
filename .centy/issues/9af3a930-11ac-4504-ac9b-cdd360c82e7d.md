# Add common trait interface for Issues, PRs, and Docs

## Background

Currently, Issues, PRs, and Docs share similar capabilities but lack a unified trait interface:

| Field | Issue | PR | Doc |
|-------|-------|----|-----|
| created_at | via CommonMetadata | via CommonMetadata | direct |
| updated_at | via CommonMetadata | via CommonMetadata | direct |
| deleted_at | direct | direct | direct |
| display_number | via CommonMetadata | via CommonMetadata | none |
| status | via CommonMetadata | via CommonMetadata | none |
| priority | via CommonMetadata | via CommonMetadata | none |
| is_org_X | yes | no | yes |
| org_slug | yes | no | yes |

## Problem

1. CommonMetadata is shared by Issue/PR but NOT by Doc
2. deleted_at is duplicated in ALL THREE types (not centralized in CommonMetadata)
3. No unified trait interface for common operations
4. OrgSyncable trait exists but only Issues implement it (Docs do manual sync)

## Context

This is Phase 1a of the item-agnostic migration (#164). The trait interfaces built here become the foundation for the config.yaml-driven item type system (#135).

## Sub-issues

- #166 Create Timestamped and SoftDeletable traits
- #167 Implement Timestamped and SoftDeletable for Issue
- #168 Implement Timestamped and SoftDeletable for Doc
- #169 Consolidate deleted_at into CommonMetadata
- #170 Implement OrgSyncable trait for Doc
