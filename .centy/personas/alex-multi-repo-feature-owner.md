  pain-points: 'GitHub issues are scoped to one repo, forcing duplicate issues or messy cross-references. When merging, easy to forget whether the daemon side or CLI side is done. Status drifts: backend merged but CLI still in progress, issue gets marked closed anyway. Each repo has its own issue tracker with different numbering — no unified view.'
  goals: Track a single logical feature or bug as one issue even when the fix spans multiple repos. Know at a glance which repos are done and which still have open work. Open worktrees in each relevant repo tied back to the same issue. Link PRs from different repos to one issue and see their statuses together.
