# Remove legacy item types: docs and issues

Remove the `doc` and `issue` item types from the centy system, one by one.

## Motivation
These built-in item types are legacy and should be replaced by generic/custom item types. Removing them reduces special-casing in the codebase.

## Scope
- Remove `issue` item type support
- Remove `doc` item type support
- Each removal done as a separate, focused change
