# Remove custom logic for legacy item types (doc and issue)

The `doc` and `issue` item types will continue to be configured via their respective `config.yaml` files (written on project init). The goal is to remove all hardcoded special-casing in the daemon so they are handled by the generic item type code path — just like any user-defined item type.

## Scope
- Remove `doc`-specific entities, actions, link/template enum variants, and hardcoded resolver fallback
- Remove `issue`-specific entities, actions, link/template enum variants, and hardcoded resolver fallback
- Keep `default_doc_config()` and `default_issue_config()` (used to generate `config.yaml` on init)
- Each type is removed in a separate, focused issue
