# Roadmap

- We want to let the user configure custom item like the default "doc" or "issue" items, the user can configure custom items like "feature", "bug", "task", etc. with custom templates for each item.

- We want to make the `.centy` folder interface to be generic as possible, so instead of calling the folder `.centy` we want to provide it a generic tasks management name and provide the user an option to configure the name with backward compatibility with `.centy`.
