# Roadmap

- We want to let the user configure custom item like the default "doc" or "issue" items, the user can configure custom items like "feature", "bug", "task", etc. with custom templates for each item.

- We want to make the `.centy` folder interface to be generic as possible, so instead of calling the folder `.centy` we want to provide it a generic tasks management name and provide the user an option to configure the name with backward compatibility with `.centy`.

- We want to let the user configure custom hooks that will be call sync or async before and after each operation like "create", "list", "delete", etc.

- We want to let the user configure editors instead of hard code for vscode and terminal

- We want to let the user configure custom templates for each item type, so they can have different templates for "doc", "issue", "feature", etc.

- We want to let the user configure custom commands for each item type, so they can have different commands for "doc", "issue", "feature", etc.
